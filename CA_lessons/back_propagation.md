# Back Propagation

# **Why you should know this**

- Back Propagation actually gives us detailed insights into how changing the weights and biases changes the overall behavior of the network.
- It helps to assess the impact that a given input variable has on a network output.
- The knowledge gained from this analysis should be represented in rules.
- Back Propagation is especially useful for deep neural networks working on error-prone projects, such as image or speech recognition.

# **Prerequisites**

- QL 1.1 Quantitative Reasoning
- DS 1.1 Data Analysis & Visualization
- DS 2.1 Machine Learning

# What is Back Propagation?

Back-propagation is just a way of propagating the total loss back into the neural network to know how much of the loss every node is responsible for, and subsequently updating the weights in such a way that minimizes the loss by giving the nodes with higher error rates lower weights and vice versa.

In short, Back Propagation is an algorithm to determine how a single training example would like to nudge the weights and biases. 

When training a network, we repeat the following steps (for¬†*n*¬†epoches):

1. Perform forward pass.
2. Calculate ‚àÜW (the delta to be added to each weight) via backpropagation.
3. Update the weights.

We will be focusing on the second step for this lesson.

# What are the steps of Back Propagation?

The 3 steps of back propagation is as follows:

1. Calculate the cost function, C(w)
2. Calculate the gradient of C(w) with respect to (w.r.t) all the weights,¬†**w**, and biases,¬†**b,**¬†in your neural network (NN)
3. Adjust the¬†**w**¬†and¬†**b**¬†proportional to the size of their gradients.

Here is an [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-maths-behind-back-propagation-cf6714736abf) that explains on how to calculate weighted sum and activation layer of a simple 1-1-1 network. 


Watch this [video lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilg3gGewQ5U) by 3Blue1Brown that explains what backpropagation really is doing.

# Exercises
Before starting on the exercies, watch this [video lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIeHLnjs5U8), to understand the calculations behind weighted sum, activation layer and cost function in Back Propagation. The lesson is a continuation from the previous video linked so make sure to watch that one as well. üìºüìù

You are given an extremely simple network, one where each layer has a single neuron in it.

Focusing on the last 2 neurons,

For the last neuron, you are given the weight and bias. You are also given the activation layer of the previous neuron.

## Exercise 1:
Calculate the weighted sum, z<sup>(L)</sup>,  based on the given variables.

w<sup>(L)</sup> = 0.5

b<sup>(L)</sup> = 1

a<sup>(L-1)</sup> = 0.25

## Exercise 2:
Write a python function to calculate the activation layer, a<sup>(L)</sup>, of a neuron. Your function should take the weighted sum z<sup>(L)</sup> as an input. For the activation function part, use the sigmoid activation function.

Here is the formula for sigmoid function:

## Exercise 3:
Use the python function that you wrote on Exercise 2 to calculate the activation layer of the last neuron. 

You will use the calculated weighted sum, z<sup>(L)</sup>, from Exercise 1 as an input here.

## Exercise 4:
Calculate the cost function of the last neuron based on the result of the activation layer from Exercise 3.

The expected output **(y)** is 1.
