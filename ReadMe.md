# DS 2.2 Deep Learning

## Course Description

Explore the cutting edge of data science: deep learning. Begin by understanding the basic computational unit of artificial neural networks: the perceptron. Study their neurological inspiration, mathematical basis in linear regression, and graphical interpretation of weights and threshold to gain an intuition for their power. Build a perceptron from scratch and train it using the perceptron learning algorithm. Explore the limitations of perceptrons and how non-linear activation functions enhance their power. Combine many perceptrons to construct feed-forward neural networks and program a training algorithm using error back-propagation and gradient descent. Compare and contrast several neural network architectures for solving problems across different domains. Use cutting-edge software libraries and tools including Keras and TensorFlow to construct large-scale networks with relatively little code. Train networks on large data sets to solve hard problems like image classification, face recognition, content generation, and style transfer. Apply these deep learning techniques to an original project and data set.

### Why you should know this?

Deep learning has shaped our world. Deep learning is the science of getting computers to learn and act like humans do, and improve their learning over time in autonomous fashion, by feeding them data and information in the form of observations and real-world interactions. It has various applications including natural-language processing (NLP), image classification and segmentation, voice recognition and deep reinforcement learning.
